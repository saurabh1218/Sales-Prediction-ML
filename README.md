# 📊 Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is an end-to-end **Sales Prediction Model** built using Python and Machine Learning.  
It predicts the sales of products based on features like product category, price, ratings, discount, and region.  
The project demonstrates data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📂 Dataset Description

Your dataset includes:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Category` | Product category (Electronics, Fashion, Home, etc.) |
| `Price` | Selling price in INR |
| `Ratings` | Customer rating score |
| `Discount` | % discount applied |
| `Region` | Sales region in India |
| `Sales` | Target variable (Actual sales quantity/amount) |

## 🔍 Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values  
- Label Encoding for categorical columns  
- Feature scaling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

### 2️⃣ Model Building
Trained multiple ML models:
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting (optional)  

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation
Used metrics:
- **MAE**
- **RMSE**
- **R² Score**
